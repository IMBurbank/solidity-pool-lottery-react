# Solidity Lottery App Front End
Repo provides basic React front end for the pool-lottery contract in my solidity-pool-lottery repo.

Contract is deployed on the Rinkeby Ethereum test network. To join the lottery, you must have a web client such as MetaMask logged into an Ethereum account on the Rinkeby test network.
